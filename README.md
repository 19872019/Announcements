# Announcements

Announcements and discussion related to course matters will be held in [the Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/announcements/issues) of this repository. Students are welcome to post an issue here, too! Note that this repo is __public__.

Use this to discuss course-specific things that are _not_ relevant to the public. Examples of discussion topics:

- Office hours
- Assignment clarifications
- Class meetings

Examples of discussion topics best left for the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) repository (because then the public can benefit from your question, too):

- Help with coding problems
- Installation issues
- Other types of computational problems

You can find the teaching team github usernames [from the homepage](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/#team).
