# Announcements

Announcements and discussion related to course matters will be held in [the Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/announcements/issues) of this repository. Students are welcome to post an issue here, too! Note that this repo is __public__.

If you want to get ahold of members of the teaching team, use these tags:

- `@545a-2019-20-instructors` -- The instructors of STAT 545A.
- `@545a-2019-20-TA` -- The TA's of STAT 545A.
- `@545a-2019-20-team` -- Both TA's and instructors of STAT 545A.

Use this to discuss course-specific things that are _not_ relevant to the public. Examples of discussion topics:

- Office hours
- Assignment clarifications
- Class meetings

Examples of discussion topics best left for the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion) repository:

- Help with coding problems
- Installation issues
- Other types of computational problems
